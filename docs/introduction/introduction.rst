Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation of my entity and spell system godot engine module.

The main purpose of this module is to make a complex (mmorpg) like multiplayer spell 
and entity setup accessible to everyone.

The module is created to be really flexible, you don't need to make realtime mmorpgs 
with it, for example you can use this in an fps game, or even in a turn based single player roguelike.

The module is set up to give as much control over everything as possible.

The source code for the module is here: https://github.com/Relintai/entity_spell_system
