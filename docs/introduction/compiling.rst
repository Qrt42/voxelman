Compiling
=========

This is an engine module, which means you'll need to compile it into godot yourself.
This might seem really daunting at first, especially if you already ran into complex build systems.
Don't worry though, compiling godot is really easy, simple, and also painless.

First make sure, that you can compile godot.

The tutorials for this are here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/development/compiling/

Now you should have godot's source code on your computer.

Now, clone ess like:

git clone https://github.com/Relintai/entity_spell_system entity_spell_system

When this finishes copy your newly created entity_spell_system folder, into godot's source's modules folder.
Like: godot/modules/entity_spell_system

Once this is done, just gompile godot as usual.
